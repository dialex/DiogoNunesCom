# Redesign Plan — Converge 3 sites into one static Astro site

**Goal:** merge the three differently-styled properties of `diogonunes.com` into a
single, unified, fully-static site built with **Astro** using the **Astrofy**
template (https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy). Deploy on GitHub Pages.

This is a companion to `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (FTP → GH Pages). That plan kept the
site as hand-written static HTML and explicitly rejected a generator. **This plan
supersedes that decision** because the blog forces a generator anyway, and Astrofy
already covers every page type the site has.

Working branch / worktree: `explore/parallel` (off `migration/gh-pages`).

---

## Current state — three separate styles

| Property | Stack today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `diogonunes.com` (root) | Bootstrap + **Freelancer** theme (`assets/css/freelancer.css`) | Hand-written static HTML (`index.html`). |
| `diogonunes.com/hireme` | Own template: `main.css` + `themes.light/dark.css` + jQuery + scrollreveal | Résumé/CV page. Separate CSS/JS world. |
| `diogonunes.com/blog` | **WordPress** (PHP + MySQL) | Not in this repo. Dynamic. |

Other static sections in repo: `/work` (projects), `/livros` (books), plus
`achievements.html`, `donate.html`, `thanks.html`, `feed/`.

---

## Target state — one Astro (Astrofy) site

Single Astro project. Output is plain static HTML/CSS/JS (`astro build` → `dist/`),
served by GitHub Pages. No PHP, no DB, no server at runtime.

Astrofy ships the exact page types we need, so the mapping is near 1:1:

| Current | Astrofy equivalent |
|---|---|
| `index.html` (root) | Home / portfolio page |
| `/hireme` (résumé) | CV page (built-in timeline) |
| `/work`, `/livros` | Projects + Store pages |
| `/blog` (WordPress) | Blog (Markdown/MDX content collection) |

Free from Astrofy/Astro: light/dark theming, RSS, sitemap, SEO/OG tags,
responsive nav, one shared layout across all pages.

## Decisions locked in

- **Stack:** Astro + Astrofy (Tailwind/DaisyUI under the hood). Output static.
- **Blog content:** export WordPress → Markdown. **User already has the `.md`
  files for each post.** (Biggest pain point already done.)
- **WP comments:** ignored / dropped. Not migrating them. (No Giscus/utterances
  unless decided later.)
- **Build step:** accepted. GH Pages will build via a GitHub Action (`astro build`,
  publish `dist/`) — this replaces the "serve branch as-is" model in
  `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.
- **Target look:** the Astrofy template (a fresh design — neither the old root nor
  the old hireme style is kept).

## Open questions (not yet decided)

- Exact URL/permalink scheme for blog posts — must preserve existing inbound links
  & SEO (set per-post `slug`).
- Image handling for blog posts (where the WP images live, how they're referenced
  in the `.md`, rewrite to local `src/assets` or keep external).
- What to do with `/work` and `/livros` content — Projects/Store pages vs. plain
  content collections.
- Whether to keep `achievements.html`, `donate.html`, `thanks.html` as-is ports or
  fold into the new design.
- Download files in `assets/downloads` — keep as static assets (no counter).

## Why Astro (context for later)

Astro is a static site generator: write content (Markdown) + reusable components,
run `astro build`, get a folder of plain HTML/CSS. The browser never sees Astro —
identical static end-state to today, but:

- Shared nav/head/footer authored **once** as components, stamped into every page
  at build (vs. copy-pasted across ~10 HTML files today).
- Blog = drop `.md` files into `src/content/blog/`; Astro generates one static page
  per post + index + RSS + tags automatically.
- One shared layout → all pages unified by construction = the "converge" goal.

Day-to-day: `npm run dev` (live preview) → edit `.md`/`.astro` → `git push` → GH
Action builds → site updates. JS/Node toolchain enters local dev.

```
your .md posts ─┐
your content    ├─► astro build ─► dist/ (plain HTML+CSS) ─► GitHub Pages
Astrofy layout ─┘
```

## Migration carry-overs from MIGRATION_PLAN.md

These still apply but get cleaner under Astro:

- **Redirects (~25 shortcuts):** use Astro's native `redirects` config instead of
  meta-refresh stub folders. (`/achievs`, `/books`, `/cv`, `/medium`, `/insta`, …)
- **PHP bits die naturally:** `privatedaddy.php` email obfuscation, the
  `downloadmanager` click counter, `assets/php/`. Static site = none of these exist.
- **GH Pages limits:** repo well within (175M vs 1GB). Fine.

## TODO — dependency upgrade (Astrofy ships old deps)

Astrofy template (v3.0.0) pins **Astro `^4.0.2`** and Astro-4-era integrations,
while Astro **5.x** is current. We already hit one symptom: `@astrojs/sitemap`
floated to 3.7.3 (needs the Astro-5 `astro:routes:resolved` hook) and crashed on
Astro 4.16 — pinned back to 3.2.1 as a stopgap.

- [ ] Audit all deps: `astro`, `@astrojs/{mdx,rss,sitemap,tailwind}`, `daisyui`,
      `tailwindcss`, `sharp`, `dayjs`, `@tailwindcss/typography`.
- [ ] Decide: stay on Astro 4 (low risk, but EOL-ing) **or** upgrade to Astro 5.
      Astro 5 changed content collections (`post.slug` → `post.id`, new
      `loader` API) — Astrofy's components use the old API, so a 5 upgrade means
      touching template code. Do this deliberately, not by accident.
- [ ] Once on a target Astro major, un-pin sitemap and move all integrations to
      matching versions. Re-run `npm run build` to confirm green.
- [ ] `npm audit` — scaffold reported vulnerabilities; review after the upgrade.

## Rough phase outline (to flesh out next)

1. **Scaffold** Astrofy in the worktree; get `npm run dev` running. — ✅ done
   (`site/`, builds clean, 16 pages).
2. **Dependency upgrade decision** (see TODO above) before building real content
   on top of a stack we might rip out.
4. **Proof of concept:** drop one real blog `.md` in, confirm it renders in style.
5. **Blog migration:** all posts in, fix images + permalinks + RSS.
6. **Port pages:** Home, CV (from hireme), Projects (from work), Store/Books
   (from livros), misc pages.
7. **Redirects** via Astro config.
8. **GH Action** build + deploy to Pages.
9. **DNS cut-over** (reuse MIGRATION_PLAN.md Step 7) + decommission FTP & WordPress.
